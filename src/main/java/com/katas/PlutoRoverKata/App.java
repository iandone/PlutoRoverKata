/**
 * Pluto Rover Kata
 * This application aims to provide a solution to the below described kata.
 * 
 * After NASA's New Horizon successfully flew past Pluto, they now plan to land
 * a Pluto Rover to further investigate the surface.
 * Develop a TDD-based API that will allow the rover to move around the planet.
 * 
 * To simplify navigation, the planet has been divided up into a grid.
 * The rover's position and location are represented by a combination of x and y
 * coordinates and a letter, representing one of the four cardinal compass 
 * points.
 * 
 * In order to control a rover, NASA sends a simple string of letters. 
 * The only commands that can be given to the rover are: 'F', 'B, 'L', 'R'.
 * The API must implement edge wrapping and obstacle detection.
